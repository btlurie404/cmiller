<title>Tai Chi and Health with Lupus Patient Testimonial</title>

<center>By John Toy</center>
<p>
The words Tai Chi invoke an image of people rhythmically moving together
in a public park at dawn, harmonizing with Nature.  Occasionally, one
sees a solitary practitioner doing the form in a pastoral setting.  What
motivates these people to rise before daylight and spend the first hour
of the day in this exercise?  Are they just getting some fresh air?
</p><p>
Certainly, fresh air accounts for part of the appeal, but if you were to
take a poll in the thousands of parks throughout Asia in which this
scene is repeated, you would find that the overwhelming reason for the
faithful practice of Tai Chi is the maintenance or restoration of
health.  Tai Chi is a system of exercise which maintains flexibility and
strength in the tradition of Western calisthenics, but more importantly,
the regular practice of Tai Chi nurtures the flow of Chi throughout the
body.  This is what makes Tai Chi special.
</p><p>
The Chinese word "Chi", means intrinsic energy and it is believed to
exist in all living things.  The Chinese firmly believe that good mental
and physical health is closely dependent upon the proper flow of Chi
through the body's "meridians".
</p><p>
We are constantly exposed to bacteria and viruses.  Why aren't we
constantly ill from infections?  Countless bacteria colonize every human
body's skin and digestive tract.  Yet we manage to coexist in harmony
most of the time.  Occasionally we become overwhelmed by these same
bacteria.  Why?  Western medicine has no satisfactory explanation for
such spontaneous and usually temporary breakdowns of the immune system.
</p><p>
Chinese medicine is very clear on this issue.  If Chi is weak or
blocked, a multitude of illness can result.  Such breakdowns are caused
by a disruption of the flow of Chi, and if they are to be cured, the
proper flow of Chi must be restored.  Chinese medicine attempts to
prevent and cure such illness by manipulating the flow of Chi through
acupuncture, herbs, massage, breathing exercises and the practice of
Tai Chi.
</p><p>
Modern (Western) medicine has been successful in furnishing protection
against many infectious diseases through vaccination and antibiotics.  
But according to Dr. David Benson of Harvard Medical School in his
forward to <em>Encounters with Qi (Chi)</em> by David Eisenberg, MD., "...only
25 percent of illnesses that bring a Western patient to a Western
physician are successfully treated by specific agents and producers.  
The other 75 percent either get better by themselves or are related to
nonspecific, mind-body interactions." <em>nonspecific</em> means
<em>unknown</em>.
</p><p>
Tai Chi can play a preventive role in maintaining good health as well
as a therapeutic one in dealing with illness.  Through the regular
practice of Tai Chi, stress is relieved, blood pressure can be lowered,
arthritic pain can be reduced and the immune system can be
strengthened.  The process does not require the use of drugs, the
exercise is gentle and age is not a limiting factor.  Throughout the
Far East as one witnesses the multitudes practicing Tai Chi in parks at
dawn each day, one has to be amazed by the number of participants who
are in their 80's and 90's.  It is estimated that over 100 million
people throughout the world practice Tai Chi on a regular basis.
</p><p>
</p><center>How Does It Work?</center>
<p>
The practice of Tai Chi consists of a series of slow rhythmic movements
that involve all parts of the body.  As the movements are made using the
whole body, the internal organs are stimulated and the mind achieves a
meditative state.  Together, these conditions stimulate the flow of Chi.
After an extended period of practice, one begins to consciously
experience this flow, thereby causing a positive re-enforcement of the
meditative state.  Breathing becomes deep and full.  One becomes
balanced, both mentally and in a very literal sense, physically.  More
importantly, the paths through which Chi flows are kept clear and open. 
The likelihood of Chi blockages and imbalance is greatly reduced.
</p><p>
The movements are mild and gentle.  The whole exercise can be merely
relaxing or intensely demanding depending on one's degree of experience
with Tai Chi. After a time, one becomes very strong physically and very
sensitive to everything within and impinging upon the body.  Improvement
depends not on outer strength, but inner awareness.  These gentle
movements, coupled with concentration and inner awareness are, according
to Chinese medicine, one of the keys to natural health and immunity to
degenerative diseases.

<strong>Lupus Patient Testimonial - re: Tai Chi Health Benefits
        (01/03/97)</strong>
<p>
I was diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus about 13 years ago
and have been hospitalized on four different occasions during the
intervening period.  In one instance I was bedridden for eight months.
</p><p>
Like many others with my condition, I have suffered severe physical and
emotional pain, with resultant intermittent periods of depression.
</p><p>
In September of 1995, things took a definite turn for the better.  I
began practicing Tai Chi and Chi Kung Meditation.  These are traditional
Chinese exercises which teaches one to establish contact and control
over one's internal energy (which the Chinese refer to as "Chi").
</p><p>
For hundreds of years many Chinese people have practiced Tai Chi to help
increase their health.  Under the guidance of my teacher, John Joy (who
teaches Tai Chi and Kung Fu in Salem, Massachusetts), I have been able
to make great strides in harnessing my own internal energy for the
purpose of improving my health.  I am happy to report that I have
experienced an unbroken period of good health and stronger energy with
no lupus flare-ups since that time.
</p><p>
I now teach Tai Chi in Concord, New Hampshire and in the Boston area.
From my own experiences, I can attest to the fact that Tai Chi and Chi
Kung can be very helpful in dealing with this devastating condition.  I
would welcome the opportunity to discuss the matter further with anyone
that is interested.
