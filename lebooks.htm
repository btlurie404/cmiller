       <font size="-1">
       <em>Being sick makes us vulnerable. When we are sick, we need understanding and
           tender loving care. Being ill with invisible chronic illness not only makes
           us particularly vulnerable, but also threatens the understanding and
           sympathy we need from family, friends, and doctors.
           </em></font><p><font size="-1"><em>
           We doubt ourselves--"Are all these symptoms real or am I going crazy?" 
           Spouses and family members often regard us with suspicion and impatience.
           Physicians misdiagnose our physical ailments and are ready to attribute the
           complaints to a mental problem.</em></font>
           </p><p>
           For millions of people who suffer from invisible chronic illnesses, like
           lupus, this book offers hope and the means to cope with their ailments.  It
           teaches them how to become aware of the attitude they have toward the 
           illness and the way they talk to themselves about it and about themselves.
           It shows how, with awareness and practice, they can change their illness
           narrative, and how they can communicate with loved ones and doctors in a way
           that meets their needs.
           </p><p>
           This book addresses issues facing the patient, family, doctors,
           employers, and fellow employees.
