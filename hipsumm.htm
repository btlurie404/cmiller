Feb 20, 2003 - Without left hip
</p><p>
After revision of failed left total hip on August 27, 2001, I developed a Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) infection.  On September 4, 2001, I had surgery for exploration/debridement left hip with
removal of total hip components.  A spacer was treated with Vancomycin antibiotic and inserted in the femur
and 3 wires were used to keep femur together.

From a CT scan 3-D reconstructive model done in 2003. This was my left non hip from August 2001 until the
summer of 2003 (22 months). It shows that most of the left pelvis had been destroyed and there is
no ball in the socket. Amazing!</p><p>

Jun 27, 2006 - New hip and additional bone growth around left socket
</p><p>
On June 24, 2003, I had surgery for re-implantation of left total hip arthroplasty.  On June 15, 2005, my orthopedic
surgeon told me that I had heterotopic ossification, Level 4 (abnormal formation of true bone within extraskeletal soft tissues) as the result of blood pooling in my 
hip after surgery.  I really believe in stem cells!

Sep 7, 2007 - More bone growth around left socket (increased heterotopic ossification)
</p><p>
My orthopedic surgeon will not remove this bone growth until it interferes with my hip range of motion.  Currently, it
only prevents me from bending over to tie my shoes.

Oct 11, 2012 - No change from 3 years ago.  Next follow-up appointment in 1 year to check if I'm still experiencing a hitch in my giddy up from right hip.

Oct 17, 2013 - Looking good; however, watch right ball and socket (put in Dec 5 1985) in a year.
