<h3><font color="810541">What Is An Ombudsperson?</font></h3>
</center>

The ombudsperson concept originated in Sweden in 1713.  King Charles XII, worried that
his monarchy was unresponsive to the concerns of the citizenry, appointed a trusted advisor to go around the country to listen to the people and keep him informed about the public's
opinion of the government.  Today the term has been extended to refer to any person who
officially investigates disputes and mediates solutions between parties in public and
private sectors.

<p>
The University Ombudsperson Committee serves as a prompt, impartial and confidential
means of facilitating dialogue between any members of the academic community as a 
means, apart from formal grievance procedures, of resolving differences.

Arizona State University has an Ombudsperson for each college and major area of the 
University who will listen to concerns of students, classified staff, administrative
staff, service professionals, academic professionals, and faculty and help them find
solutions to their problems.
