<font size="+1" color="810541"><strong>Cyndee's Tips for New Lupus Patients</strong></font><br>

<p>
</p><ul>
   <li><strong>Each case of lupus is different.</strong>
       <ul>Get to know your disease, which type, and which parts of the body are involved.
       </ul>
    
   </li><li><strong>Build an honest and open relationship with your doctor.</strong>
       <ul>It takes time to find the right medication and the dosage that works best to
           control your situation.
       </ul>

   </li><li><strong>Do not play with your medications!</strong>
       <ul>Learn about them, the purpose for taking them and the side effects which you
           might encounter.  Discuss with your doctor and pharmacist.
       </ul>

   </li><li><strong>Be honest with yourself and others.</strong>
       <ul>"Fine, thank you" is not always appropriate.  "Off day" or "Sorry, I can't go
           out today" may be more applicable.
       </ul>

   </li><li><strong>Don't be deceived by periods of feeling good.</strong>
       <ul>The first three years are a roller coaster involving mini flares,
           experimentation and medication combinations, and life-style adjustments.
       </ul>

   </li><li><strong>It is normal to grieve the loss of the "old" self.</strong>
       <ul>Learn to come to terms with your disease.  Try to befriend it, not deny it.
       </ul>

   </li><li><strong>Give yourself permission to be depressed for short periods of
        time.</strong>
       <ul>Develop a sense of humor and a positive attitude, then get on with living.
       </ul>

   </li><li><strong>Pamper yourself!</strong>
       <ul>This is your chance to sit back and let others do things for you.  At first
           it is difficult to say, "Please, help me" but it gets easier with practice.
           Patience is an asset.
       </ul>

   </li><li><strong>Keep a journal of symptoms, medication dosages and their side effect,
        plus your feelings.</strong>
       <ul>It will come in handy each time you visit your doctor.
       </ul>

   </li><li><strong>Seek a support group.</strong>
       <ul>It is helpful to talk to others who have been through similar experiences to
           yours.
       </ul>

   </li><li><strong>And remember...You are not alone!</strong>
</li></ul>
