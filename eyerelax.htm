<p>
Put your palms directly over your eyes.  Block out all light without putting
too much pressure on your eyelids.  Try to see the color black.  You may see
other colors or images, but focus on the color black.  Use a mental image to
remember the color, i.e., black tar.
</p><p>
Continue this way for two to three minutes, thinking and focusing on black.
Slowly open your eyes, gradually getting accustomed to the light.
Experience the sense of relaxation in the muscles that control the opening
and closing of your eyes.
</p><p>
Color imagery and eye relaxation can be done when you need a technique and
don't have much time.  They are fun and will keep relaxing interesting.  Try
to slip one into your regular activities every now and then.
