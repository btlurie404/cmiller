Ban of Current Incandescent Light Bulbs
</p><p>
On December 19, 2007, President Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (Public Law No: 110-140)
Under the new law, all light bulbs must use 25% to 30% less energy than today�s light bulbs by 2012-2014. Since today�s
incandescent light bulbs do not fit the energy efficiency standard, there will be a phase-out of current incandescent
light bulbs. The phase-out will start with 100-watt bulbs in January 2012 and end with 40-watt bulbs in January 2014.
By 2020, bulbs on the market must meet the 70% efficiency standard.
</p><p>
Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) already meet the 70% efficiency standard, which means that most public spaces
and homes are switching to CFLs. As you may know, <font color="CD3333">some reports suggest that there may be enough UVB radiation in
fluorescent light bulbs to cause photosensitivity in people with lupus.</font>
</p><p>

The LFA government relations staff has been working with other groups affected by this legislation to form a coalition:
Sjogren�s Syndrome Foundation, National Psoriasis Foundation, Epilepsy Foundation, MAGNUM, and American Academy of Neurology.
The LFA government relations staff and this coalition have scheduled meetings on Capitol Hill and are working with the
light bulb industry to determine whether a new incandescent light bulb will be released before January 2012.
