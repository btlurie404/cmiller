Mamma you were an inspiration to me. Besides being a loving wife to daddy for 65 years and mother of 5 children, you were able to juggle your schedule to meet everyone's needs and still found time to have �me� time. Thank you for helping me through the many flare-ups of my lupus. You always knew how to pick me up when I was down and gave me words of encouragement.
</p><p>
You hold a very special part of my heart. I will love you forever. I miss you mamma. I'll see you when God calls me home. </p><p>
Your loving daughter, CC.
