<title>Impact of Cyndee's Lupus on her brother, Paul</title>

</center>
<p>
My name is Paul Quinn Guerrero, and I am Cyndee's youngest brother.  Cyndee was diagnosed
with Lupus the same year that I was born, and thus, my memory growing up with her begins
after she had been living with Lupus for 5 years.
</p><p>
I was too young to truly understand Lupus, and the affects that the disease had on my
sister.  The only thing I knew was that she had a disease that prevented her from being in
the sun.  The other thing I remember about her disease was that it affected her joints,
and that prevented her from walking for long periods of time.  My most vivid memory of
this was during a family reunion in Los Angeles, CA.  I believe I was about 8 years old,
and the family went to Disneyland.  Cyndee had to be pushed around in a wheelchair the
whole day, and carried an umbrella to keep her in the shade.
</p><p>
I began figure skating, and Cyndee was always supportive in any way she could be.  If
she couldn't travel with me to a competition, she would give me a photo of herself to put
in my luggage.  When she could attend a competition, she would hold onto my good luck
mascot, a Snoopy stuffed toy, and cheer really loud.  Her mouse-like voice would
resonate above the crowd, and I could hear "GO Booby!" (Pronounced B-uhb-bee) from the
bleachers.
</p><p>
I can remember sitting next to her while she played the piano and singing along while
she played the guitar.  She would spend time with me teaching me everything she would do
in her spare time.  I learned to play the piano, how to knit, and how to play the
octagon (similar to an organ).  Once, she even helped me with my bowling game when I
was upset with how poorly I bowled compared to the rest of my family.
</p><p>
My fondest memories growing up with Cyndee are spending time with her playing cards,
putting jig-saw puzzles together, and just hanging out with her.  To me, she was just my
big sister, and I rarely thought of her as being sick.  Only when she would have to be
hospitalized for a relapse of Lupus, would I remember that she had the disease.
</p><p>
As I grew older, I became more aware of her disease after the years of taking steroids
caused her to have a hip replacement.  That is when I first realized the extent that
her disease was taking on her body.  When she and her husband, Bob, decided to move to
Arizona because of her health, I remember being sad.  I was happy for her, because I
knew that the warmer climate would be kinder to her joints, but I was sad, because I
would miss spending free time with her.
</p><p>
Even though we don't see each other as often as we used to, whenever we do see each
other, we always find time to play a game or two.  I'll be 33 years old this year
and that also reminds me that Cyndee has been living with Lupus for the same number of
years.  I am so proud of what she is doing with her Lupus website, and how she is able
to help other people with Lupus cope and survive.  In the past year, I have met people
who have recently been diagnosed with Lupus, and I immediately refer them to my
sister's website.
</p><p>
Cyndee, you have touched so many people's lives...I love you!!!
