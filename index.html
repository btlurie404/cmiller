<p>
Lupus is a chronic, autoimmune disease which causes inflammation of various parts of the body, especially the skin, joints, blood, and kidneys.  The immune system normally protects the body against viruses, bacteria and other foreign materials.  In an autoimmune disease like lupus, the immune system loses its ability to tell the difference between foreign substances and its own cells and tissues.  The immune system then makes antibodies directed against "self."
</p><p>
Lupus is NOT infectious, rare or cancerous.
</p><p>
The Lupus Foundation of America market research data show that between 1.4 million and 2 million people have been diagnosed with lupus.  (Study conducted by Bruskin/Goldring Research, 1994.)
</p><p>
Although the cause of lupus is unknown, scientists suspect that individuals are genetically predisposed to lupus, and know that environmental factors such as infections, antibiotics, ultraviolet light, extreme stress and certain drugs play a critical role in triggering lupus.
</p><p>
Lupus affects 1 out of every 185 Americans.  Although lupus can occur at any age, and in either sex, 90% of people with lupus are women and during the child bearing years lupus strikes women 10-15 times more frequently than men.  Lupus is more prevalent in African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans and Asians.
</p><p>
Only 10% of people with lupus will have a close relative (parent or sibling) who already has or may develop lupus.  Only about 5% of the children born to individuals with lupus will develop the illness.
</p><p>
Lupus can be difficult to diagnose as the symptoms come and go and mimic many other illnesses.  Some symptoms of lupus can be transient joint and muscle pain, fatigue, a rash caused by or made worse by sunlight, low grade fevers, hair loss, pleurisy, appetite loss, sores in the nose or mouth or painful sensitivity of the fingers to the cold.
</p><p>
Sunlight, infection, injury, surgery, stress or exhaustion can trigger "flare-ups" of lupus (a more active state of the disease).
</p><p>
Although lupus ranges from mild to life-threatening and thousands of Americans die with lupus each year, the majority of cases can be controlled with proper treatment.
</p><p>
Increased professional awareness and improved diagnostic techniques and evaluation methods are contributing to the early diagnosis and treatment of lupus.  With current methods of therapy, 80-90% of people with lupus can look forward to a normal lifespan.
</p><p>
While medical science has not yet developed a method of curing lupus, new research brings unexpected findings and increased hope each year.
</p><p>
The Lupus Foundation of America has nearly 100 local chapters directly providing patient services, education, awareness and research in their local areas.
</p><p>
The disease comes in three forms: discoid lupus, which is limited to the skin and often identified by a rash on the face, neck or scalp; systemic lupus, which can affect almost any organ or system of the body; and drug-induced lupus, which presents itself after the use of certain prescribed drugs.

<p></p></center>
A new survey conducted by the Lupus Foundation of America found that those at greatest risk for the disease have never heard of lupus or know little or nothing about lupus beyond the name. <b>Understanding this fuels great urgency for increased understanding and awareness of lupus</b>.
<p>
We wanted to learn how we could make our voice heard louder to increase public awareness and understanding of the disease. To do this, we conducted extensive research among people with lupus, their families, physicians, scientists, and other stakeholders.  We asked them how we should talk about lupus.  Their words came through loud and clear.  The answer: <b>Identify lupus for what it is -- a disease that is agonizingly puzzling, physically challenging, complex, and hard to define.</b><u> In short, it is the cruel mystery.</u>
</p><p>
With these clear words, a new look, and new national initiatives, we are stepping-up our efforts as a result of these findings. <b><i>Help Us Solve the Cruel Mystery™</i></b> is the Lupus Foundation of America s new rallying cry to achieve our goals.
</p><p>
To support our efforts, we launched the <b><i>Help Us Solve the Cruel Mystery™ </i>National Tour</b>, a multi-city education and awareness initiative designed to engage the public, healthcare providers, Members of Congress, and those with the disease to join the fight to end lupus.  You can learn more about this exciting program and how you can join the fight by visiting the campaign website at 
<a href="http://cruelmystery.org/" target="_blank"> cruelmystery.org.</a>
</p><p>
As you know, our mission is to improve the quality of life for all people affected by lupus through a comprehensive program of research, education, and advocacy.  This mission is not changing.  Together we will lead the fight to find the causes and cure for lupus.  To learn more, visit our web site

<p>
</p></center>
<strong>Advocates Earn Significant Victory for Lupus Research</strong>
<p>
A Department of Defense (DoD) Appropriations bill that includes $$5 million in funding for the Lupus Research Program in 2018 was just passed today by the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee.  This funding is in addition to the $5 million that Congress provided earlier this year for 2017.
</p><p>
The additional funding for the Lupus Research Program brings the two-year total for the program to $10 million and comes just two days after the Lupus Foundation of America s (Foundation) National Policy Summit and Advocacy Day on Capitol Hill. This funding is critical to the fight against lupus as it will help us learn what causes lupus and can advance the development of new treatments for our military heroes and the 1.5 million Americans living with the disease.
</p><p>
During the Foundation s advocacy day this week,<strong>our lupus activists visited more than 200 Congressional offices and sent over 5,500 emails reaching nearly 400 U.S. Representatives and 98 U.S. Senators</strong>, all in an effort to urge their Members of Congress to increase funding for lupus research and ensure access to quality health care. Lupus advocates  year-round grassroots efforts made a significant impact on the Committee s decision to continue funding for the Lupus Research Program.
</p><p>
We also thank the leaders of the House Appropriations Committee, including Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ), and the Congressional Lupus Caucus Co-Chairs Rep. Thomas J. Rooney (R-FL), Rep. William Keating (D-MA), Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) and Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX) for championing this funding increase for lupus research.
