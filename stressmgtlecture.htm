<hr>
<p>
A lecturer when explaining stress management to an audience, raised a glass of water and asked<br>  
"How heavy is this glass of water?"
</p><p>
Answers called out ranged from 20g to 500g.
</p><p>
The lecturer replied, "The absolute weight doesn't matter.<br>
It depends on how long you try to hold it.
</p><p>
If I hold it for a minute, that's not a problem.
</p><p>
If I hold it for an hour, I'll have an ache in my right arm.
</p><p>
If I hold it for a day, you'll have to call an ambulance.
</p><p>
In each case, it's the same weight, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes.
</p><p>
He continued, And that's the way it is with stress management.
</p><p>
If we carry our burdens all the time, sooner or later,<br>
as the burden becomes increasingly heavy, we won't be able to carry on. 
</p><p>
As with the glass of water, you have to put it down for a while and rest before holding it again.
</p><p>
When we're refreshed, we can carry on with the burden.
</p><p>
So, before you return home tonight, put the burden of work down.<br>
Don't carry it home.<br>
You can pick it up tomorrow.
</p><p>
Whatever burdens you're carrying now, let them down for a moment if you can.
</p><p>
So, my friend, put down anything that may be a burden to you right now.<br>
Don't pick it up again until after you've rested a while.
</p><p>
<font color="810541"><strong>Here are some great ways of dealing with the burdens of life:</strong></font>
</p><p>
Accept that some days you're the pigeon,<br>
and some days you're the statue.
</p><p>
Always keep your words soft and sweet,<br>
just in case you have to eat them.
</p><p>
Always read stuff that will make you look good<br>
if you die in the middle of it.
</p><p>
Drive carefully.<br>
It's not only cars that can be recalled by their maker.
</p><p>
If you can't be kind, at least have the decency to be vague.
</p><p>
If you lend someone $20 and never see that person again,<br>
it was probably worth it.
</p><p>
It may be that your sole purpose in life is simply be kind to others.
</p><p>
Never put both feet in your mouth at the same time,<br>
because then you won't have a leg to stand on.
</p><p>
Nobody cares if you can't dance well.<br>
Just get up and dance.
</p><p>
Since it's the early worm that gets eaten by the bird, sleep late.
</p><p>
The second mouse gets the cheese.
</p><p>
When everything's coming your way, you're in the wrong lane.
</p><p>
Birthdays are good for you.<br>
The more you have, the longer you live.
</p><p>
You may be only one person in the world, but you may also be the world to one person.
</p><p>
Some mistakes are too much fun to only make once.
</p><p>
We could learn a lot from crayons...<br>
Some are sharp, some are pretty and some are dull.<br>
Some have weird names, and all are different colors,<br>
but they all have to live in the same box.
</p><p>
A truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery on a detour.
</p><p>
Have an awesome day and know that someone has thought about you today...I did.
