<font size="+2" color="810541"><strong>HOLD ON</strong></font>
<p>
Hold on to your <strong>FAITH</strong><br>
It is the source of believing that all things are possible. It is the fiber and strength
of a confident soul.
</p><p>
Hold on to your <strong>HOPES</strong><br>
It banishes doubt and enables attitudes to be positive and cheerful. 
</p><p>
Hold on to your <strong>TRUST</strong><br>
It is at the core of fruitful relationships that are secure and content. 
</p><p>
Hold on to your <strong>LOVE</strong><br>
It is life's greatest gift of all, for it shares, cares, and gives meaning to life.
</p><p>
Hold on to your <strong>FAMILY</strong> and <strong>FRIENDS</strong><br>
They are the most important people in your life, and they make the world a better place.</p><p>
They are your roots and the beginnings that you grew from. They are the vine that has
grown through time to nourish you, help you on your way, and always remain close by.
</p><p>
Hold on to all that <strong>YOU ARE</strong><br>
And all that you have learned, for these things are what make you unique.  Don't ignore
what you feel and what you believe is right and important.  Your heart has a way of
speaking louder than your mind.
</p><p>
Hold on to your <strong>DREAMS</strong><br>
Achieve them diligently and honestly.  Never take the easy way or surrender to deceit.
</p><p>
Remember others on your way and take time to care for their needs.
</p><p>
Enjoy the beauty around you. Have the courage to see things differently and clearly.
</p><p>
Make the world a better place one day at a time, and don't let go of the important things
that give meaning to your life.
</p><p>
<strong>HOLD ON.....</strong><br>
To each of the above...do not let them fall to the ground to be trampled by others...<br>
for they are <strong>YOURS!!</strong>
