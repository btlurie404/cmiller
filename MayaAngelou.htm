<p>
I've learned that no matter what happens, or how bad it seems today,<br>
life does go on, and it will be better tomorrow.
</p><p>
I've learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he/she 
handles these three things:<br>
a rainy day, lost luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights.
</p><p>
I've learned that regardless of your relationship with your parents,<br> 
you'll miss them when they're gone from your life.
</p><p>
I've learned that making a 'living' is not the same thing as 'making a 
life'.
</p><p>
I've learned that life sometimes gives you a second chance.
</p><p>
I've learned that you shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt on 
both hands;<br>
you need to be able to throw some things back.
</p><p>
I've learned that whenever I decide something with an open heart,<br>
I usually make the right decision.
</p><p>
I've learned that even when I have pains,<br>
I don't have to be one.
</p><p>
I've learned that every day you should reach out and touch someone.<br> 
People love a warm hug, or just a f riendly pat on the back.
</p><p>
I've learned that I still have a lot to learn.
</p><p>
I've learned that people will forget what you said,<br>
people will forget what you did,<br>
but people will never forget how you made them feel.
</p><p>
