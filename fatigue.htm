Fatigue is common in chronic illness.  Managing fatigue is an important component of
learning to live with a chronic illness.  Fatigue can lead to depression, anger, a loss of
physical and cognitive skills, and a lack of motivation.  Sleep can also be a problem.
Work simplification and energy conservation help reduce fatigue.
<p>	
There are five strategies to help manage fatigue by conserving energy and using it wisely:
planning, positioning, pacing, prioritizing, and adaptive equipment.  One needs to think
things through and plan one's time on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.  Try to distribute
strenuous work throughout the day rather than doing it all at one time.  Try to rest before
doing hard work.  Plan specific tasks to do them most efficiently.  Try to eliminate extra
trips.  Recreation is important, so plan to spend some energy on fun activities.
</p><p>
Use the body in good alignment and it will use less energy to do a task.  Maintain good
posture to take the strain off joints.  Use a wheeled cart around the house and sit while
working to conserve energy.  Arrange work and storage areas to be more efficient.
</p><p>
Pacing is difficult but important.  Try to avoid a rush; it just uses up more energy.
Rest before you tire.  It is most efficient to rest ten minutes out of every hour, but most 
people have trouble fitting that into their daily routine.  It is usually possible, however,
to add some additional rest during the day.  Spread work throughout the day with planned
rest breaks.
</p><p>
Alternate light/heavy, sitting/standing and fast/slow activities.  Be selective about
activities.  Prioritize which tasks are essential to get done, which can be eliminated and
which can be delegated.  Try to simplify so that which needs to be accomplished can be done
in an easier fashion.  Stand back and look at the situation - then reorganize.
</p><p>
Use labor-saving devices and adaptive equipment that will conserve energy.  Look for short
cuts.  Use convenience foods like cake mixes and adapted equipment like jar openers to make
the job easier.  Changing habits for energy conservation seems awkward at first but becomes
easier over time.  It is also possible to reduce fatigue by building energy resources and
addressing psychological factors.
</p><p>
Exercise to stay in good condition.  Emphasize exercise as well as rest.  One loses 3% of
one's strength for each day of inactivity.  Strive for an energy-building program of gentle
aerobics that doesn't strain the body.  Swimming, bicycling (indoors or out), cross-country
skiing, rollerblading, fast walking and dancing are good activities.  Try to work exercises
into your daily routine.  There may be some initial discomfort when starting, but avoid
overkill, pace yourself and rest as necessary.  Expect only slow and gradual improvement.
(See Note)
</p><p>
Fatigue is depressing and depression is fatiguing.  Fatigue can be a symptom of depression
which is common in chronic disease.  Significant depression should be evaluated to determine
if medication is needed.
</p><p>
Continually striving for perfection and being harsh and demanding of oneself also leads to
fatigue.  Those who set unreasonably high and rigid standards for themselves become depressed
and fatigued when they can't meet the standards.  They are never satisfied.  They can exhaust
themselves struggling to meet unreasonably high expectations.  When feeling frantic, take a
break and rest for a few moments and think the situation through.  Things will go better and
will be less fatiguing.  Examine expectations and try to determine whose they are-yours or
someone else's.  Don't wear yourself out meeting expectations that are unreasonable or
unimportant to you.
</p><p>
Take what limited energy you have and learn to use it wisely.  Try to accommodate fatigue
since it will be difficult to conquer.  Try not to be too independent, and don't be afraid
to ask for help.  Build your energy resources through exercise and make changes to help deal
with the psychological component of low energy-a better quality of life will be the result.

<strong>Note:</strong>  Dr. Evelyn V. Hess adds this caution on exercise: "The extent of the
exercise program depends on the associated disease e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, SLE with
arthritis etc."  Consult your physician.
