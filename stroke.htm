<strong><font size="+1">Brain Attack!</font></strong>
<p>
Stroke is a "brain attack," cutting off vital supplies of blood and oxygen
to the brain cells that control everything we do--from speaking, to walking,
to breathing.  A stroke happens when an artery leading to or in the brain
becomes blocked or ruptures.  These arteries can be blocked by blood clots
(formed in the heart or elsewhere in the body) or by the gradual build-up of
plaque and other fatty deposits.  Brain arteries can rupture when weak spots
on the blood vessel wall break.
</p><p>
Stroke is our nation's third leading killer and the primary cause of adult
disability.  Every year, stroke strikes nearly 550,000 Americans--killing
150,000 and forever changing the lives of the 400,000 who survive.
</p><p>
National Stroke Association is now using a new term to describe stroke --
<strong>"Brain Attack"</strong> -- which tells us:<br>
</p><ul>
   <li>Stroke affects the brain -- the body's most vital organ<p>
   </p></li><li>Stroke strikes suddenly -- often without warning<p>
   </p></li><li>Stroke is a medical emergency -- requiring immediate care<p>
</p></li></ul>

<strong><font size="+1">Why Stroke is an Emergency</font></strong>
<p>
For someone who is having a stroke, emergency medical treatment could make
all the difference between life and death...the difference between brain
cells that can be saved and brain cells that never recover..the difference 
between recovery and lifelong impairment.
</p><p>
For every minute that brain cells are deprived of oxygen and die during
stroke, brain damage increases and injures more of the brain.  Recent
medical research tells us that when a stroke happens, brain cells in the
area of the stroke aren't the only ones in danger.  Through a process called
<strong>secondary injury</strong>, dying brain cells set off a "chain
reaction" of electrical and chemical events.  These events endanger -- and
can kill -- brain cells in a much larger, surrounding area.  As a result,
the abilities or functions once controlled by these brain cells -- such as
speech and movement -- are impaired or lost.
</p><p>
<strong><em>The sooner medical treatment starts after stroke symptoms begin,
the better the chances for survival and successful rehabilitation and
recovery.</em></strong>
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<strong><font size="+1">Stroke Treatment Today</font></strong>
<p>
It's critical for someone who experiences stroke symptoms to get to the 
hospital as quickly as possible.  Once there, doctors can act rapidly to
evaluate the stroke and determine the best, most effective treatment.
</p><p>
At the hospital, doctors will confirm the diagnosis of stroke and perform
tests -- such as a CT scan -- to learn the stroke's size, location, and
cause.  This is important because medical and surgical treatment options
will vary depending on whether the stroke resulted from a blocked artery or
a hemorrhage.
</p><p>
<strong><em>The sooner someone with stroke symptoms gets to the hospital,
the sooner doctors can begin appropriate treatment.</em></strong>
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<strong><font size="+1">Hope on the Horizon</font></strong>
<p>
Medical researchers and stroke specialists believe that we are very close to
having breakthrough treatments which will "stop a stroke in its tracks."
Several promising drugs are now being tested to determine their potential
effectiveness.  These drugs fall into two categories:  "clot-busters" and
"brain-saving" neuroprotective agents.  "Clot-busters" are used to rapidly
dissolve stroke-causing blood clots and limit brain damage by restoring the
free flow of blood.  Neuroprotective agents disrupt the processes that kill
previously-healthy brain cells in the area surrounding the stroke.
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<strong><font size="+1">Stroke Research - In Your Community</font></strong>
<p>
Hospitals and doctors in your community are taking part in a national effort
to test promising new drugs for emergency stroke treatment.  This means
stroke patients in your community have a unique opportunity to receive 
potentially life-saving -- and brain-saving -- treatment.
</p><p>
<strong><em>In order to participate in this vital research, persons with
stroke symptoms must get to the hospital immediately after symptoms begin.
Stroke patients who delay cannot take part.  Every minute counts!
</em></strong>
</p><p>       
</p><hr>
<strong><font size="+1">Know the Symptoms of Stroke!</font></strong>
<p>
It's important to learn and recognize the symptoms of stroke--not only for
yourself, but because you may see them in someone else who doesn't
understand their significance.
</p><p>
<strong><em>The faster you recognize stroke symptoms, the sooner you can get
to the hospital and receive treatment.  This is even more critical because
of the stroke treatment research available in your community.</em></strong>
</p><p>
If you experience any of the following symptoms--or recognize them in 
someone else--<strong>call 911 immediately!</strong></p><p>
</p><ul>
   <li>Numbness, weakness, or paralysis of face, arm, or leg--especially
       on one side of the body<p>
   </p></li><li>Sudden blurred or decreased vision in one or both eyes<p>
   </p></li><li>Sudden and severe headache with no apparent cause--often described
       as "the worst headache of your life"<p>
   </p></li><li>Difficulty speaking or understanding simple statements<p>
   </p></li><li>Dizziness, loss of balance, or loss of coordination--especially when
       combined with another symptom
</li></ul>
<p>
<strong>Stroke is an Emergency ... Call 911</strong>
</p><p>
If you experience any of these symptoms or recognize them in someone else,
call 911 -- even if the symptoms only last for a short time.
</p><p>
Stroke is an emergency!  Don't delay -- call 911 immediately!
