85, passed away on March 26, 2013 in Mesa, Arizona.  She was preceded in death by her husband of 65 years, Severo, son, Michael, and brother, James.  She is survived by her children Cyndee Miller, Kathy Arendarczyk, Eugene, and Paul; 5 grandchildren; 6 great-grandchildren; sister, Josephine Rodriguez.
She was born in Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija, Philippines and moved to the U.S. with her late parents, Florentino and Sophia Dait, in 1930.  They lived on a farm and operated a family store in Holtville, CA.
While her husband served in the U.S. Army, earned his medical degree and practiced medicine, she maintained a warm home environment, shuttled her children to their activities, worked part-time jobs, sang in choral groups, played the piano and violin, enjoyed many hobbies, and participated in sports with the family.  She also competed in the Arizona Senior Olympics, winning a silver medal in Group Aerobic Dance in 2000, a gold medal in Individual Aerobic Dance and a silver medal in Group Aerobic Dance in 2001 and a gold medal in the 5K Racewalk in 2003.
She was an active member in the community; played key role with her husband in welcoming new members and enhancing the programs for Red Mountain Senior Center; where she volunteered thousands of hours setting up for daily lunches and preparing over 600 frozen meals for residents coming home from the hospital; certified caregiver for 8 years.
She was a faithful servant of the Lord, loving mother and a friend to many.  Her husband lovingly called her �Sunshine� since she always had a smile on her face.
If you would like to wear a flower clip in your hair to honor her, please feel free to do so.
The family would like to personally thank the Hospice of the Valley for their amazing "Earth Angels", Kristi, Avell, Tammy, Virginia, Anna, Tana, &amp; Emily, who kept Mom comfortable and pain free until the end.
