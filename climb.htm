<title>Climb 'Til Your Dream Comes True</title>

<p>

Often your tasks will be many,<br>
And more than you think you can do.<br>
Often the road will be rugged<br>
And the hills insurmountable, too.</p><p>

But always remember, the hills ahead<br>
Are never as steep as they seem,<br>
And with Faith in your heart start upward<br>
And climb 'Til you reach your dream.</p><p>

For nothing in life that is worthy<br>
Is never too hard to achieve<br>
If you have the courage to try it<br>
And you have the Faith to believe.</p><p>

For Faith is a force that is greater<br>
Than knowledge or power or skill<br>
And many defeats turn to triumph<br>
If you trust in God's wisdom and will.</p><p>

For Faith is a mover of mountains.<br>
There's nothing that God cannot do,<br>
So start out today with Faith in your heart<br>
And "Climb 'Til Your Dream Comes True" !</p><p>

- Helen Steiner Rice (1900 - 1981)
